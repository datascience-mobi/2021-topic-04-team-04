    "pixels which are assigned to the same region, but are not connected can appear.\n",
    "This leads to differences in the region merging process. While region merging by intensity distance\n",

    "A problem we faced when performing region merging on results of the unseeded region merging were\n",
    "the unconnected pixels, which where assigned to a large region. Therefore, they were not\n",
    "merged to their neighbors, because the overall size of the region was above the threshold.\n",
    "This resulted in spots, which resembled salt and pepper noise. In order to improve our result,\n",
    "we used a median filter with a 3x3 sized filter mask. This improved our dice score.\n"
