    "Region growing is an interesting approach for image segmentation which can be used to evaluate microscopy images and detecting cell structures.\n",
    "It is further divided it into seeded and unseeded region growing. <br>\n",
    "In this project, algorithms for both seeded and unseeded region growing are implemented and executed on the datasets N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and NIH3T3.\n",
    "Preprocessing and parameter adjustment for merging is applied for difficult datasets to reduce noise and focus on the important information.\n",
    "The dice score evaluates the result and the performance of the algorithm by comparing the segmented images to a manually segmented ground truth image. <br>\n",
    "Both seeded and unseeded region growing algorithms lead to very good results with high dice scores up to 0.99 for simple segmentation tasks.\n",
    "The vectorization of the algorithm allows acceptable speeds despite the large computing power required, since each pixel is assigned individually and intermediate steps in the algorithm are permanently updated.\n",
    "A simultaneous allocation of the pixels could lead to equally good results and faster runtime.\n",
    "Interfering image elements with strongly deviating pixel intensities compared to their neighborhood are still a challenge to be overcome.\n",
    "Even after applying the algorithm, some pixels will not be segmented properly and must be added by manual parameter determination. <br>\n",
    "With an improvement of the runtime by simultaneous assignment of the pixels and automatic parameter determination in combination with better preprocessing, these challenges could be mastered and a more robust algorithm could be obtained.\n",

    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is an image processing program in the field of data analysis, whose role has become increasingly important in recent years.\n",
    "It consists in grouping pixels of the image by commonalities of image intensities and thus creating regions of pixels that can be used for data analysis and evaluation.\n",
    "In this way, image content can be simplified, and its representation can be modified by using methods like thresholding, boundary or region-based segmentation or hybrid techniques.\n",
    "Image segmentation is often the first step in image analysis. It is widely used, especially in the medical field, but also in the processing of geographical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Region growing is a subset of the hybrid techniques of image segmentation which can be used for cell nuclei segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class of methods can be further subdivided into seeded and unseeded region growing, while the focus in this project lies on seeded region growing.\n",
    "Here, selected initial seeds are assigned pixels from the neighborhood if their relative Euclidean distance to the seeds is below a certain threshold.\n",
    "Subsequently, certain regions are merged to combine similar or small regions (Shih and Cheng, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the seeded region growing algorithm, its performance will be evaluated.\n",
    "For this, result images are compared to already segmented gt-images by using the Dice score.\n",
    "Finally, seeded and unseeded region growing are also compared with each other using the Dice Score.\n",

    "# Datasets – N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and NIH3T3\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run and test the implemented seeded region growing algorithm, three different datasets were used: N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and NIH3T3.\n",
    "The datasets consist of a total of 28 image files, in which different structures of the nucleus were stained using the fluorescent protein GFP.\n",
    "Attached to the data sets are gt-images where the nuclei have already been segmented.\n",
    "The images and gt-images of these datasets are often used to evaluate the performance of newly implemented algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset has specific challenges that need to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first dataset N2DH-GOWT1, transcription factor Oct 4 was stained by GFP in mouse embryonic stem cells.\n",
    "The nuclei are well in focus and do not overlap.\n",
    "There are no reflections or blurs.\n",
    "However, the stained nuclei differ greatly in brightness.\n",
    "Compared to the other data sets, N2DH-GOWT1 is considered to be the easiest to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "N2DL-HeLa shows GFP labeled core histone 2b proteins from human cervical carcinomas.\n",
    "Overall, the cell density is high whereas the resolution is low, and the nuclei vary greatly in brightness.\n",
    "Furthermore, the intensity values of the images lie between 33 000 and 36 000.\n",
    "There are no interfering effects due to reflections or blurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last dataset NIH3T3 consists of mouse embryo fibroblasts.\n",
    "EGFP was used to label the CD-tagged protein.\n",
    "In NIH3T3 the nuclei are displayed in a very low contrast and differ strongly in their size and shape.\n",
    "Very bright regions, presumably caused by reflections from the microscope, probably make this data set the most challenging.\n",

    "An advantage and disadvantage of unseeded region growing is its smaller number of region.\n",
    "However, a disadvantage of unseeded region growing are additional filtering methods which need to be applied after region merging.\n",
    "Since both algorithms still showed good results and dice scores they can be considered in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation only the dice score was used.\n",
    "Thereby, the weighted dice score lead to more meaningful results compared to the unweighted dice score because it\n",
    "considers nuclei and background equally.\n",
    "Still high weighted dice scores are received even if many nuclei are missing because of the impact of the background.\n",
    "Differences of ground truth images, and the received results are partly caused\n",
    "by mistakes in the ground truth images which don't show some nuclei, especially on image borders.\n",
    "Because of these to problems, other evaluation methods should be considered in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the big runtime improvements, the runtime in both proposed algorithms is still too long. An algorithm which\n",
    "labels more than one pixel in one iteration could fix this problem. That's why we recommend using another algorithm\n",
    "of another paper in following research.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, both segmentation lead to satisfactory results with specifically adjusted parameters for each image.\n",
    "Nevertheless, in future research the process of determining parameters needs to be automated\n",
    "to make it available for everyone and to gain actual time reduction in nuclei detection via image segmentation."
