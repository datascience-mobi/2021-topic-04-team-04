    "\n",
    "Region growing is an interesting approach for image segmentation which can be used to evaluate microscopy images and\n",
    "to detect cellular structures like nuclei.\n",
    "In this project, algorithms for seeded and unseeded region growing are implemented. These methods are used to form\n",
    "regions, by assigning all pixels in the image. The major difference of the two algorithm is the start: while seeded\n",
    "region growing starts form initially calculated seeds, unseeded region growing starts from a randomly chosen start\n",
    "pixel. After regions are detected, they are merged to prevent oversegmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the implemented algorithms were executed on the datasets N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and NIH3T3.\n",
    "In order to reduce noise, preprocessing was performed on the images. To further improve results, the parameters\n",
    "used during region growing were adjusted for each data set. To evaluate the segmented image, the Dice score was used.\n",
    "For this, the obtained result images were compared to manually segmented ground truth images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both seeded and unseeded region growing algorithms led to good results with high Dice scores up to 0.95 for plain\n",
    "images. A disadvantage of the implementation is, that large computing power is required because each pixel is\n",
    "assigned individually. However, vectorization led to an acceptable speed.\n",
    "An improvement of the algorithm would be the simultaneous allocation of more than one pixel.\n",
    "This could result in equally good Dice scores and faster runtime.\n",
    "A further issue are interfering image elements with intensities similar to\n",
    "nuclei and this is still a challenge to be overcome.\n",
    "Another future improvement would be an automatic parameter determination for the different parameters used in\n",
    "preprocessing, seed detection and region merging. In this project, all parameters were determined manually.\n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is an image processing method in the field of data analysis, which role has become increasingly\n",
    "important in recent years.\n",
    "It consists of grouping pixels of an image by similarity of image intensities and thus creating regions of pixels\n",
    "that can be used for data analysis and evaluation.\n",
    "In this way, image content can be simplified, and its representation can be modified by using methods like\n",
    "thresholding, boundary or region-based segmentation or hybrid techniques.\n",
    "Image segmentation is often the first step in image analysis. It is widely used, especially in the medical field,\n",
    "but also in the processing of geographical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Region growing is a subset of the hybrid techniques of image segmentation which can be used for cell nuclei\n",
    "segmentation. This class of methods can be further subdivided into seeded and unseeded region growing, which will both\n",
    "be implemented in this project. In seeded region growing, selected initial seeds are assigned pixels from their\n",
    "neighborhood if the pixels have a high intensity similarity. Subsequently, certain found regions are merged if they\n",
    "are similar in their mean intensity or if they are to small (Shih and Cheng, 2005). In unseeded region growing, the\n",
    "region growing is initiated using a start pixel. Another threshold is used and if the intensity distance of a newly\n",
    "assigned pixel is too high, a new region is formed. After unseeded region growing, region merging is performed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the seeded region growing algorithm, its performance will be evaluated.\n",
    "For this, result images are compared to already segmented gt-images, and the Dice score is calculated.\n",
    "Finally, seeded and unseeded region growing are also compared with each other using the Dice Score.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to run and test the implemented seeded region growing algorithm, three different datasets were used:\n",
    "N2DH-GOWT1, N2DL-HeLa and NIH3T3.\n",
    "The datasets consist of a total of 28 image files, in which different structures of the nucleus were stained using the\n",
    "fluorescent protein GFP.\n",

    "In the first dataset N2DH-GOWT1, transcription factor Oct 4 was stained by GFP in mouse embryonic stem cells.\n",
    "The nuclei are well in focus and do not overlap.\n",
    "There are no reflections or blurs.\n",
    "However, the stained nuclei differ greatly in brightness.\n",
    "Compared to the other data sets, N2DH-GOWT1 is considered to be the easiest to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images of the N2DL-HeLa data set show GFP labeled core histone 2b proteins from human cervical carcinomas.\n",
    "Overall, the cell density is high whereas the resolution is low, and the nuclei vary greatly in brightness.\n",
    "Furthermore, the intensity values of the images lie between 33 000 and 36 000.\n",
    "There are no interfering effects due to reflections or blurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last dataset NIH3T3 consists of mouse embryo fibroblasts.\n",
    "EGFP was used to label the CD-tagged protein.\n",
    "In NIH3T3 the nuclei are displayed in a very low contrast and differ strongly in their size and shape.\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "Despite the challenges of the different data sets images of each data set could be segmented successfully\n",
    "using preprocessing. Especially in the first data set N2DH-GOWT1 satisfying results and high Dice scores were obtained.\n",
    "In the second data set (N2DL-Hela) normalizing and preprocessing could be used to gain high Dice scores.\n",
    "Little challenging images of the NIH3T3 data set led to high Dice scores as well.\n",
    "However, especially in images with bright spots and differing image intensities lower Dice scores where obtained.\n",
    "Even though these challenges could be solved on image fragments, the resources didn't suffice to solve these issues\n",
    "on the whole image because of too long runtimes. This needs to be addressed in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing, especially clipping, of the images improved the results and is therefore recommended.\n",
    "For filtering a median filter showed to improve results on images for unseeded region\n",
    "growing and image clipping improved the results of seeded region growing. On difficult\n",
    "data sets, a Gauss filter was additionally used to improve seed detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both, seeded and unseeded region growing, lead to good results,\n",
    "unseeded region growing was more robust against challenging image parts.\n",
    "One reason is that the seed detection in seeded region growing often fails to detect nuclei\n",
    "or background regions between nuclei.\n",
    "Increasing the number of seeds could solve this problem, but it leads to memory errors.\n",
    "Alongside less memory errors and smaller execution times for region merging, the smaller region number in unseeded\n",
    "region growing leads to bigger, unconnected regions with several nuclei. This compensates small intensity distances\n",
    "of nuclei to their background in bright background areas or because of dark nuclei.\n",
    "However, challenge of unseeded region growing are additional filtering methods which need to be applied after\n",
    "region merging.\n",
    "Since both algorithms still showed good results and Dice scores, they can be considered in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluation only the Dice score was used.\n",
    "To gain a meaningful Dice score all background regions need to be merged together.\n",
    "This requirement complicates segmentation on images which differing background intensities and leads to worse results.\n",
    "Differences of gt-images and the received results are partly caused\n",
    "by mistakes in the gt-images, which do not show nuclei on image borders.\n",
    "Because of these problems, other evaluation methods should be considered in future research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the big runtime improvements, the runtime in both proposed algorithms is still too long. An algorithm which\n",
    "labels more than one pixel in one iteration could fix this problem. This is why using another algorithm\n",
    "is recommended in following research.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, both segmentation algorithms lead to satisfying results.\n",
    "Nevertheless, in future research the process of determining parameters needs to be automated to gain actual time\n",
    "reduction in nuclei detection via image segmentation."
